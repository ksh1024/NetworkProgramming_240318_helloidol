   <pre>Bye-bye
Boy, bye, hmm
Hmm
Bye-bye
And boy, bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah
This ain't the first time I've been hostage to these tears
I can't believe I'm finally movin' through my fears
At least, I know how hard we tried, both you and me
Didn't we? Didn't we?
So I grab my stuff
Courtney just pulled up in the driveway
It's time
Bye-bye
Boy, bye
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah
Bye-bye
I'm takin' what's mine, yeah
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah
You know, I'm stronger than I think
Usually, I'd join you on the floor, but this dance ain't for me
Boy, just turn the music up
Maybe, someday we'll look back with love
Didn't think you'd lose me
Now it's just too late to choose me
So I grab my stuff
Courtney just pulled up in the driveway
It's time (it's time)
Bye-bye
Boy, bye (boy, bye)
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah
Bye-bye
I'm takin' what's mine, yeah (takin' what's mine)
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah
Now it's certainly bittersweet
This hook feels too hard to sing
But it's better than repeat (than repeat, than repeat, than repeat)
Bye-bye (bye-bye)
Boy, bye (boy, bye)
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah (bye)
Bye-bye (bye-bye)
I'm takin' what's mine, yeah (takin' what's mine, ooh)
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah (ooh)
Bye-bye (bye-bye)
Boy, bye
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah (bye)
Bye-bye (bye-bye)
I'm takin' what's mine, yeah (I'm takin' what's mine)
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah
